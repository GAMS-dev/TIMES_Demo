This folder contains an illustrative example for using TIMES-Macro, 
based on the demo12 model, and using the MLF formulation.

For illustration of the Macro performance with a state-of-the-art LP solver,
these model run examples by default require a license for GAMS/Cplex
(but can be run also with other LP solvers like the open solver CBC).

One can run the examples with GAMS in the subfolder, using the command:

> gams rundemo

If the CBC solver is preferred instead, one can use the following:

> gams rundemo LP=CBC
